## Welcome to the ConfuzeDB Project Code Page ##

The purpose of this project is to create a completely custom MaNGOS database not based on blizz. This project is to help developers learn mysql and to learn how to create a MMORPG game world.

Confuzed Development Community is a small community of developers who are starting many projects. We plan to expand and host other development projects. If you have a project that you would like to start then email xadinwow@gmail.com. We can provide forums, wiki, websites. In the future we will be hosting trac, svn, and more. So if you want to join our team and start your own project to day, no matter what programming or scripting language, then email xadinwow@gmail.com. Also we encourage others to make their own MaNGOS database and will help with this. Hopefully in the end the many projects can help to create one whole database but that is entirely up to you.

If you are a developer for this project then make sure to join up. If you would like to join our team for this project then email xadinwow@gmail.com and register at confuzedb.dnsdojo.net. There is no forum access until admin accepts you so dont forget to email also.
